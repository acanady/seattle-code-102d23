                    This has been an age-old discussion in the nerd community and I’ve personally seen it get tense because of the passion between the two groups. With the recent ‘shelving’ of Star Trek 4, fans have been disgruntled. Does that mean Star Trek isn’t a viable franchise? I don’t think so, even though I’ve been trolling Star Trek forums (it’s fun), I think Star Trek holds a special place in the sci-fi landscape.

                    A few weeks I got a chance to sit down with our Nerdbot commander-in-chief, Elvin, who is an avid Star Trek fan and it got me thinking. I’ve been a hardcore Star Wars fan since I was 6 years old, for a long time it was Star Wars or die attitude, but after watching a season with Elvin, I was entertained, surprisingly. I remember watching the syndicated Star Trek shows and the movies when I was young and not being a fan. Star Trek as always been “slow” to me. What I mean by that is when it comes to action packed space battles and laser-swords whizzing everywhere, Star Trek didn’t have that. What it does have is a Twilight Zone feel during every episode, which was very popular during it’s release in 1966. Arguably, Star Trek paved the way for sci-fi shows and movies, so respect is given, and Gene Roddenberry is godfather to the genre. So the question still remains…is it better than Star Wars?
